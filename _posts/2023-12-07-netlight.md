Navigating the tech industry can be overwhelming, especially with the vast number of companies, technologies, and career paths available. That’s why we partnered with experienced tech recruiters at [Netlight Consulting](https://www.netlight.com/) to host a Career Lunch Event—a unique opportunity for students to gain valuable insights into personal branding, networking, and career development.

The event kicked off with a communication workshop, where participants learned how to effectively articulate their skills, career goals, and personal strengths. Understanding how to present oneself in professional settings is crucial, and this session provided key strategies for making meaningful industry connections.

Following the workshop, attendees had the chance to engage in individual CV and LinkedIn coaching, receiving tailored feedback on their professional profiles. Whether it was fine-tuning resumes, optimizing LinkedIn presence, or discussing strategies to stand out in the job market, these 1-on-1 sessions provided practical, personalized advice to help students take their next career steps with confidence.

The final session focused on personal branding, emphasizing the importance of visibility in the tech industry. Participants explored ways to showcase their expertise, build professional relationships, and create a strong presence both online and offline.

Beyond the workshops, the event provided a fantastic networking environment where students could connect with recruiters and peers over lunch in a relaxed setting. It was inspiring to see so many talented individuals eager to refine their career paths and take proactive steps toward their future.

A huge thank you to Netlight Consulting for sharing their expertise, and to everyone who joined us for this insightful session. We hope you left feeling empowered and ready to tackle the next stage of your career!
