Our Python Best Practices event was a fantastic opportunity to dive deep into one of the most widely used programming languages! We had the pleasure of hosting a speaker from Bloomberg, who shared expert insights on writing clean, efficient, and maintainable Python code.

Throughout the session, participants gained valuable tips that will help them in university projects, technical interviews, and future careers. The event also featured a networking session, where attendees connected with industry professionals and gained insights into the development process at IT companies like Bloomberg.
