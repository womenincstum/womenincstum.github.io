In our recent PhD journey event, we had a panel discussion with PhD students at TUM, School of CIT, followed by a networking session with 8 PhD students.


## Panel Session with 3 PhD students from TUM School of CIT

Let's get to know our panelists!

### Julia Schuller

Julia Schuller is a PhD student at the chair of Software and Systems Engineering at TUM. Her research focuses on integrating the ethical principles of autonomy and empowerment into the engineering process. With a bachelor's degree in Informatics from TUM and a master's degree in Social Sciences of the Internet from the University of Oxford, she embraces interdisciplinary research and enjoys critical debates transcending disciplinary boundaries.

Julia is invested in high-quality teaching and creating a respectful study environment. In her free time, she is part of a feminist book club and loves swimming.

### Xiao Wang
Xiao Wang joined the Cyber Physical Systems group as a PhD student in 2019. She received her M.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from Technical University of Munich and her B.Eng. in Vehicle Engineering from Tongi University in Shanghai, China. Her current research focuses on safe reinforcement learning and its applications to autonomous vehicles.

### Stefanie Mohr

Stefanie Mohr has studied Mathematics at LMU and Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence at TUM. She has started her PhD 2020 at TUM at the chair for Theoretical Computer Science, where she is working on the Verification of Neural Networks.

## Panel Discussion and Q&A

At the panel, we asked the PhD students various questions on their PhD journey and learned about their motivation and how they get started. We then learned about how the bachelor's students and the master's students can get in touch with them, find someone to supervise their research and engage with a research group at one of the TUM chairs.

We later talked about the challenges of pursuing a PhD and how they stay motivated throughout this process. We also asked them about how they would describe their journey in a field where the percentage of female PhD students is very low. 

Next, we got questions from the audience on various topics like what are the expectations during a PhD and regulations for applying a PhD at TUM.


## Networking Session

Our event was later followed by a round table session where the students joining event were able to ask further questions to more PhD students depending on their area of interest. At the networking session, we had 8 PhD students working on various research areas like Robotics & AI, Computer Vision, Theoretical Informatics and Software & Systems Engineering.
