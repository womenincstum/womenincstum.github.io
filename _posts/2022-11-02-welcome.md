## You asked, we answered!

In this year's welcome event, we briefly talked about what Women in CS@TUM community does, how to be a member or take part in the organizational team.

We then heard stories from three different students in our department Ana Petrovska (Ph.D. candidate), Hanya Elhashemy (Master's student) and Roeya Khlifi (Bachelor's student). Our members talked about their learnings from studying computer science, motivated new students who are starting their studies and shared helpful survival tips. They answered the questions from the audience on a variety of topics regarding our community, graduate programs at TUM and more.

We look forward to see you in our upcoming events. 

Stay tuned for our upcoming PhD journey event!
