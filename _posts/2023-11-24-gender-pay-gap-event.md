Breaking the Silence: A Powerful Discussion on the Gender Pay Gap with Maxi Görnitz

Recently, we had the pleasure of hosting Maxi Görnitz for an eye-opening discussion about the gender pay gap. The event brought together students eager to dig into a topic that impacts women in every industry—especially female students in STEM.

Maxi guided us through the complexities of the gender pay gap, explaining how it has evolved, what it looks like today, and, most importantly, what we can do to help close it. She really got us thinking about how this issue affects women in tech and STEM fields, where gender disparity is still a very real challenge.

For many of us—especially those studying in fields like engineering, computer science, and other STEM disciplines—this conversation could not have been more timely. Women are still underrepresented in these areas, and that often leads to a pay gap when we enter the workforce. Maxi's talk emphasized why it is crucial for female STEM students to understand these issues early on. She shared tips on how to advocate for ourselves, negotiate salaries, and demand fair compensation as we move forward in our careers.

One key takeaway from the event was that knowledge is power. Having open discussions about the gender pay gap and the challenges women face in STEM helps us break down barriers and shift the conversation. Maxi encouraged all of us to speak up, stand our ground, and ensure we are not leaving money on the table just because we are women in male-dominated fields.

We are incredibly grateful to Maxi for her expertise and for making this conversation happen. It was an important reminder that the fight for gender equality is far from over—it is ongoing, and we need to keep having these tough discussions. For female students in STEM, understanding the pay gap is a crucial step toward taking control of our futures.

Thanks to everyone who joined us—it was a powerful evening, and we are already looking forward to the next one!
