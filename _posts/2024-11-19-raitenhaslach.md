We gathered in the beautiful TUM Science & Study Center Raitenhaslach for a weekend of collaboration, connection, and inspiration. Nestled by the Salzach River, the retreat was the perfect setting for working sessions, engaging discussions, and fun team-building activities.

From delicious meals and group games to brainstorming sessions and a night walk, every moment helped us strengthen our community and welcome new members. The trip reinforced our shared vision and commitment to growing Women in CS @ TUM.
