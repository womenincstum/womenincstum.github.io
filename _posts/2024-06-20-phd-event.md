Exploring the PhD Journey: Insights from our Panel Discussion and Networking Event

![](/assets/images/content-2024/phd-event-2024-1.jpg)

Pursuing a PhD in Computer Science is an exciting yet challenging path, and to help students navigate this journey, we hosted an insightful PhD Panel and Networking Event. The evening brought together aspiring researchers and current PhD students for an open discussion about academic careers, research opportunities, and personal experiences in the field.

The event began with a panel discussion, where female PhD students from various TUM chairs shared their journeys—their motivations, challenges, and key learnings along the way. They offered invaluable advice on choosing a research area, finding the right professor, and maintaining passion despite the ups and downs of academia.

Following the panel, attendees had the chance to participate in roundtable networking sessions, where they engaged in direct conversations with PhD students from different research areas. These smaller, interactive discussions allowed students to ask specific questions, gain deeper insights into various fields of study, and build connections within the academic community.
