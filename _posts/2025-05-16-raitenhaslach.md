Team building trip to the beautiful TUM Science & Study Center Raitenhaslach

Earlier this semester, we spent a wonderful weekend at the TUM Science & Study Center in Raitenhaslach—and it was just what we needed. Set against the peaceful backdrop of the Salzach River, the retreat brought our community together for a few days of learning, connecting, and recharging.

From collaborative workshops and open discussions to evening walks and game nights, every part of the trip helped us grow closer as a team. It was a great mix of productivity and fun, and the perfect way to welcome new members into the Women in CS @ TUM family.

We left feeling inspired and energized, full of fresh ideas and a renewed sense of purpose. Being surrounded by so many passionate and supportive women reminded us why we do what we do—and how much we can achieve when we work together.
