Welcoming Our New Members

Following our successful recruiting event, we held a productive onboarding session to welcome our new members. The event was designed to introduce them to the resources, opportunities, and support systems available within our club. New members had the chance to meet their team leads and fellow members, learn about upcoming projects, and even propose their own ideas.

We focused on fostering a collaborative and inclusive environment, ensuring everyone felt supported as they begin their journey with WinCS. From workshops to networking events, we outlined how our members can get involved and make the most of their time with us. We are excited to have such a passionate and diverse group of new members and canâ€™t wait to work together to continue creating positive change in the tech industry!
