This year, the members of Women in CS @ TUM gathered with high spirits to celebrate our annual Christmas party—a perfect blend of networking, gift exchange, and heartfelt reflection that left us all with a profound sense of connection.

The Women in CS @ TUM Christmas party is more than just an annual event—it is a true reflection of the vibrant and dynamic spirit of our group. As the night drew to a close, we departed with full hearts—grateful for the laughter, the memories, and the connections we have shared. We are excited about what the new year holds and look forward to another year of growth, empowerment, and the ongoing support of our cherished community.

Here’s to another year of making meaningful memories and supporting one another in the journey ahead!
