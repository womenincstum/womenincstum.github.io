Empowering the Future: A Warm Welcome to New Members

At the start of the summer semester, we hosted an exciting recruiting event for Women in Computer Science @ TUM, where we introduced our club to new students and shared the opportunities we offer. The event was a great way to talk about our mission of empowering women in tech while creating a friendly space for students to learn about our values and community. Through meaningful conversations, participants could connect with each other and current members while getting a glimpse of our supportive environment.

We also shared details about our upcoming projects and workshops, which help members grow both personally and professionally. It was inspiring to see so much enthusiasm from students eager to join our efforts in promoting diversity and inclusion in STEM. We can’t wait to welcome new members who are passionate about making a positive change in the industry, and we’re excited about what we can achieve together!
