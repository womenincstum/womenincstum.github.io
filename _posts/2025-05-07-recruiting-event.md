Kicking Off the Semester: Our 2025 Recruiting Event

![](/assets/images/content-2025/recruiting-event-1.jpeg)

Recently, we hosted our annual recruiting event for Women in Computer Science @ TUM, introducing new students to our club and the opportunities we offer! It was so exciting to meet so many new students curious about what we do and eager to get involved. The event was a chance for us to share who we are, what we stand for, and how we support women and other underrepresented groups in tech.

We also took some time to share what’s coming up in the club: projects, workshops, and mentorship programs that help our members grow both personally and professionally. It was really encouraging to see so many students excited about getting involved and contributing to a more diverse and inclusive tech community. We’re looking forward to welcoming new faces and working together to make a real impact in STEM!
