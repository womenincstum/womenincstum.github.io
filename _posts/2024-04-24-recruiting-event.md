Recently, we hosted a successful recruiting event for Women in Computer Science @ TUM, introducing new students to our club and the opportunities we offer. The event was a fantastic way to share our mission of empowering women and other under-represented groups in the tech industry, providing a welcoming space for students to learn about our work and values. Through engaging conversations and networking, attendees were able to connect with current members and get a sense of the community we have built.

During the event, we highlighted our upcoming projects, workshops, and mentorship opportunities, which allow members to grow both personally and professionally in STEM. It was inspiring to see so many students interested in joining our efforts to foster diversity and inclusion in STEM. We are excited to welcome new members who are passionate about making a positive impact in the tech world and look forward to what we can achieve together.
