Introducing Our Club to Freshmen at the SET Fair 2023

![](/assets/images/content-2023/set-fair-1.jpg)

At this year’s [SET fair](https://mpic.fs.tum.de/studium/studienbeginn/set/), we again had the chance to meet many incoming students, share our club’s vision, and talk about our exciting upcoming events.

We were also proud to promote our focus on equal participation and support for women and other underrepresented groups in our community. And, of course, it was great to connect with so many of you who are eager to get involved!

If you missed us, don’t worry—catch us at the next student club fair for more info and opportunities!
