Inspiring the Next Generation of Female Tech Leaders

At the end of May, we had the privilege of hosting the CS Schnupperstudium 2024, a 3-day experience for schoolgirls in grades 10-12, and it was truly inspiring! Over the course of three days, the girls dove into the world of Computer Science, attending lectures on everything from Algorithms to Computer Vision and Robotics. They did not just sit in classrooms, though – they also had the chance to roll up their sleeves and apply what they learned in hands-on activities, making the experience both educational and fun.

What really stood out was the energy and curiosity these young minds brought to the event. It was incredible to see how excited they were about the topics and how eager they were to ask questions, try new things, and push their boundaries. Whether they were learning about Robotics or discussing Software Engineering, they were fully engaged and ready to explore what tech has to offer.

This event was more than just a chance to learn about Computer Science; it was about opening doors and showing these girls that there is a place for them in the tech world. We can’t wait to see where their curiosity leads them and are excited to think that some of these young women could one day be the ones shaping the future of technology. We are proud to be part of their journey and can’t wait to see what they will do next!
