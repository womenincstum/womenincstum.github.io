Welcome to the webpage of Women in CS @ TUM, formerly known as Informatik-Forum Frauen (IFF)!

We are a student community at the [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.in.tum.de/), School of Computation, Information and Technology, working towards equal participation of women and other under-represented groups in computing and IT. Our focus spans fields such as computer science, computer engineering, data science, and mathematics. It is a joint initiative of students, scientific staff and professors who are passionate about fostering diversity within our school.

Throughout the semester, we organize monthly events covering a range of topicsâ€”from navigating CS careers in industry and academia to study tips and personal development. You can take a look into some of our [past events](/archive) for further information. 

Our events are open to everyone interested regardless of gender, nationality or academic status. You can follow us on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/women.in.cs.at.tum/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/women-in-computer-science-tum/), and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/IFFTUM/) to stay tuned for the upcoming events!
