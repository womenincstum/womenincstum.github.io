Welcome to the webpage of Women in CS @ TUM, formerly known as Informatik-Forum Frauen (IFF)!

We are a student community of members of [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.in.tum.de/) at School of Computation, Information and Technology, working towards equal participation of women and other under-represented groups in relevant field of computing and IT, including computer science, computer engineering, data science and math. It is a joint initiative of students, scientific staff and professors who are involved in the topics of diversity in our school.

We organize monthly events throughout the semester on a variety of topics such as how to pursue a CS career in industry or academia, study tips and self-development. You can take a look into some of our [past events](/archive) for further information. Our events are open to everyone interested regardless of gender, nationality or academic status. You can follow our Instagram, LinkedIn and Facebook page to stay tuned for the upcoming events.

The best way to engage with us is through our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/G7Ru7YdBsc). Feel free to join, introduce yourself and get in touch with our members!
